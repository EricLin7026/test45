<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Interest in IT: </h2>
<p style="text-align:center;" > The Information Age is shaping up to be an age as unprecedented and revolutionary as the Industrial Revolution that preceded it. Everything is gradually becoming intertwined with the digital web. My interest in IT is as much out of necessity as it is interest. To be unequipped with the necessary skills during arguably one of the most important stages of mankind is willful foolishness. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;">My interest in IT began at a young age. Since I was born, the digital world was a constant presence in my life, only greatening as I grew up. From playing Flash Games during the 2000s and seeing the rise of Youtube during the 2010s, the importance of IT has only greatened over time. I took an IT Software Development elective during High School, learning C# and the basics of information systems.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I came to RMIT mostly due to the convenient commuting from my home to the City Campus, and because Monash wouldn’t accept a 70 atar for a STEM course without a lot of hoop-jumping. I was unwilling to do for a piece of paper gained from an isolated Campus I would have to spend 2 hours every day just to travel to. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Ultimately I suppose I have a very casual view of life, there is no need to tire yourself out by constantly giving 100% effort in everything. The ability to correctly assess what is worth giving 100% is in my opinion a far greater skill to possess, and I believe IT is one of those things worth putting effort into. </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Ideal Job:</h2>
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51875046?type=standout#searchRequestToken=357365c7-a0b4-49b9-9d83-b9f7c700c63d">Seek Ideal Job</a>
<p style="text-align:center;">I am seeking a profession in microbiology, in a position where I would be able to do practical and worthwhile work where I am intellectually challenged to seek new and creative solutions to problems. I do not necessarily believe I absolutely have to achieve groundbreaking and revolutionary work, however, I do believe I should aim to achieve something like it. </p>

<img src="Job Listing.png" width="400" height="200" style="width:50%;" >

<p style="text-align:center;">For the job I’ve listed, I would be working with vaccines and antigens, understanding optimal viral growth conditions and which CVV to roll out for the yearly Flu Shot. Due to the constantly changing and evolving nature of viruses and the vast field of immunology, I believe such a profession has practical importance, meaningful value and challenging enough that I would need to constantly learn and improve. 
</p>

<p>The qualifications required are:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li>Tertiary qualifications in relevant Biological or Pharmaceutical Science</li>
    <li>Minimum 3-5 years of relevant experience in the pharmaceutical industry or related process development</li>
    <li>Good knowledge of the influenza virus, manufacturing process and regulatory requirements</li>
    <li>Scientific assays including but not limited to Hemagglutination, SRID, EID50, SDS-Page, Lowry and BCA protein assay</li>
    <li>Sound scientific development and investigation skills</li>
    <li>Good knowledge of GLP, GMP, DAWE, OGTR and EHS Guidelines relevant to product development and manufacture</li>
    <li>Demonstrated ability to make process improvements</li>
    </ul>

<p style="text-align:center;">While this list seems extremely daunting, even to someone who hopes to achieve it sometime in their life. I do believe I can achieve this. As I am currently studying Biotechnology, I am already on the way to completing the first requirement. Afterwards, it is a matter of amassing the relevant experience. There are plenty of beginner jobs for a biologist, and the recent Covid pandemic has hopefully sparked better funding so that people would be more on the toes for the next big pandemic. 
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I admit I don’t have much of a concrete plan beyond ‘Get Degree, find a job’, but I feel like that is fine. I am among countless young students still flailing about in their lives. Would panicking and trying to plan out my life for the next decade do anything other than stress me out? I am in no particular rush to get to my goals in life, to me, it is better to have taken the steps steadily than hurried.

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Personality Profile:</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">INTP-A</h4>
<img src="MBTI.png" style="width:50%;" >
<p style="text-align: center;">A fairly rare personality type according the MBTI site, with only 3% of the population compromising it.</p>

<h4>Strengths:
</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>Great Analysts and Abstract Thinkers</li>
<li>Imaginative and Original</li>
<li>Open-Minded</li>
<li>Enthusiastic</li>
<li>Objective</li>
<li>Honest and Straightforward</li>
</ul>

<h4>Weaknesses:</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li>Very Private and Withdrawn</li> 
    <li>Insensitive</li>
    <li>Absent-Minded</li>
    <li>Condescending</li>
    <li>Loathes Rules and Guidelines</li>
    <li>Second-Guess Themselves</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">Thoughts:</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;">I do believe I am very logically minded, however, I don’t really think the term ‘special’ really applies to me. Even if I am only 3%, that’s still like 20 million people in the world. I do find the results in general to be very scarily accurate in regards to me, though I’m not sure how it will influence me when I’m in a team. According to this test I should do horribly in team environments, but usually, I find some small but important role and diligently fill it whilst someone else takes the leadership position. These results won’t change that, though I will be more on the lookout for an extrovert suited for leadership to take the helm.</p>

<hr>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">IPIP Big Five Factor Markers:</h3>
<img src="Big 5.png" style="width:50%;" >
<p style="text-align: center;">The Big Five test only seems to reinforce what was already said in the MBTI test, though I never really found myself to be the disagreeable sort, which is my lowest score on the Big Five markers. It might be a problem of bias. I can’t see what other people think of me, so I may be entirely wrong when I say I’m agreeable. Once again I see myself fulfilling an intellectual role on a team. 
</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Learning Style</h3>

<a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml">EducationPlanner.org</a>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li>Auditory: 15%</li> 
    <li>Visual: 60%</li>
    <li>Tactile: 25%</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;">My Learning Style likely won’t alter my thoughts on my role inside a team. I see it as more a personal metric to understand yourself, after all, being a visual learner doesn’t mean I’ll be good at teaching people visually.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Project Idea:</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;">For my project idea, I originally thought of creating a purely comedic self-help blog that parodied the often misinformed existing self-help blogs that advocate for things like salt crystals, but I realised that while it would be funny, it would not have that great of practical and real-world impact. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">So instead I decided to go with creating an online plant simulation website, focused on exotic and often unreported plant life. Such a simulation would allow the user to choose the plant, customize environmental conditions such as rainfall, temperature, soil pH and nutritional value. I believe such a website would hold great educational value, especially for those in the younger generation (Primary-Secondary Schooling), as a beginner path to become interested in our ecosystem. Having an open-ended simulation allowing a user to customise and test all conditions they could think of could lead to greater interest in the biological field. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The skills required would range across both the IT and Biological fields, the site will actually need to be programmed, and someone needs to provide accurate information of plant growth to form the basis of the simulation. A proper hosting server would obviously be needed, as is an unused address. Not only that, in order for the program to purposed for a younger demographic, it needs to be artistically child-friendly and memorable, without compromising educational value, so a graphic designer is also needed. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The difficulties of this would be obtaining accurate statistical information about various types of plants to plug into the simulation, along with programming the simulation itself. The simulation would need to accurately display the likely real-world outcome of the plants it is simulating. Depending on the budget, however, the simulation will likely have to remain 2D, which does make HTML and CSS an ideal, if basic, method to use.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The benefits of such a program could be increased interest in plant life and an easier way to understand it, not through a stiff learning environment or pages upon pages of text, but through childhood curiosity to test and try every variable until they grow something that works. As a young child, I could remember logging onto sites like Cool Math’s Games during class and sneaking a few Flash games in. Whilst I don’t believe my project idea would ever be used by a child for recreation, it would be a useful tool for the suffering secondary school teacher who has nothing to give to their class and just tells them to play around with educational games under the pretence of: “Well, they’re learning aren’t they?”
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">If the site is successful, a future project could be expanding and creating a hosting site for various education-related games and simulations. Perhaps add a competitive factor to it, I remember I tried my hardest in math when the class was playing Mathletics. Overall, I hope such a project, if ever coming to fruition, would be a popular tool amongst students and teachers to both learn and teach the basics of plant systems. </p>
